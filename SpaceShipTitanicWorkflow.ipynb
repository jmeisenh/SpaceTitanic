    "In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.\n",
    "File and Data Field Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### train.csv - Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.\n",
    "**PassengerId** - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**HomePlanet** - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence. **CryoSleep** - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.  \n",
    "**Cabin** - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.  \n",
    "**Destination** - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.  \n",
    "**Age** - The age of the passenger.  \n",
    "**VIP** - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.  \n",
    "**RoomService**, **FoodCourt**, **ShoppingMall**, **Spa**, **VRDeck** - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.  \n",
    "**Name** - The first and last names of the passenger.  \n",
    "**Transported** - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.  "

    "+ **PasengerID** may need to be split into group and ID, possibly even an engineered feature for group size  \n",
    "+ Luxury amentities could be transformed to weather or not a passenger used a facility and total amount spent\n",
    "+ Name as it exists is useless for categorizing, however breaking it into first and last name and determing if travling in a family unit is more likely to result in transportation is an experiment to run  \n"
